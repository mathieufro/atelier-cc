# Atelier anti-yield Stop hook — the scripted yield guarantee (rewrite-spec §2.2).
#
# Blocks the orchestrator from yielding mid-autonomous-execution. Gated PURELY on
# the persisted state machine (state.json), never on `stop_hook_active`: Claude
# Code sets that flag on every main-loop re-entry after a blocking Stop —
# including the legitimate re-entry after an Agent tool call returns — so keying
# an exit off it would strand the pipeline after the first block. (old stop.sh
# documented this; stop-hook.bats is the regression test.)
#
# Three gates, all read from durable state:
#   1. ANTI-YIELD  — status==running & awaiting==null → BLOCK (mid-autonomous).
#   2. DEFINITION-OF-DONE (D1) — status==complete is honored ONLY once the flow's
#      terminal stage (validate / last of plan[]) is in done[]; else BLOCK a
#      premature completion. This is the gate that the format-moat run tripped:
#      it set complete with done[] ending at `implement`, 7 stages early.
#   3. WORKFLOW-STRAND (D2) — awaiting=="workflow" is allowed while a fan-out is
#      plausibly in flight, but if the wait has gone stale (no progress in
#      WORKFLOW_STALE_SECS) → BLOCK so the orchestrator collects/relaunches it.
#      Staleness is tracked in an `.await-since` sidecar (hook bookkeeping, not
#      pipeline state); it can only fire on a yield, so it catches a "forgot to
#      clear awaiting" drift, not a fully dead session (only the workflow
#      completion notification or a manual /atelier resume rescues that).
#
# ALLOW (exit 0) otherwise: no owned running pipeline · failed · legitimately
# complete · awaiting:user · awaiting:workflow still fresh.
