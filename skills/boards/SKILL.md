description: The owner-facing artifacts — the proof board (cards with evidence and two verdict layers), the decision board (options the owner clicks), and the gate file (VERDICT and SIGNED lines only the owner writes) — how to build, publish, read back, back up and republish them.

# Boards and gates

Three shapes the owner already uses. They are the medium for every human judgement in the
flow; nothing else asks.

## Files

```
.atelier/pipelines/<id>/board/
  catalog.json               the cards
  proof/<ITEM-ID>/result.json  my verdict and evidence per card (proof board)
  proof/<ITEM-ID>/*            evidence files: png/jpg, wav/mp3, txt/log
  config.json                title, intro, facts, round note
  site/                      generated: index.html + proof/_m/<hash>.<ext>
  verdicts-<date>.json       backups of the owner's verdicts
.atelier/pipelines/<id>/qa/   the final QA board (validating section 4), same layout as board/,
                              plus brief.md (the agent brief) and README.md (the proof contract)
.atelier/pipelines/<id>/gates/<id>.md   gate files
```

The final QA board lives in `qa/`, apart from the per-phase `board/`: its own catalogue, its
own page and URL, its own verdicts.

**Keep it off `/tmp`.** A scratch directory under `/tmp` or `/private/tmp` is swept by the OS
(macOS deletes files not accessed for three days); one run lost 204 proof records overnight.
The board directory lives in the run directory above, or in a durable folder the run links
to, never only in a session scratchpad.

## Catalog

`catalog.json` is an array of cards:

```json
{"id":"T2-PUI-08","kind":"check","group":"Perform UI","title":"Macro knob moves the mapped parameter",
 "what":"Turning macro 1 changes the filter cutoff on both voices.",
 "where":"Perform view, macro row","check":"Cutoff readout follows the knob within one frame; audio RMS above 1 kHz rises.",
 "gate":"tests/e2e/perform.spec.ts:88","priority":"P0","automatable":"yes","source":"S4"}
```

The final QA board adds `"tier"` (risk or rollout stage, e.g. `T1` ships first) and
`"proof"`, the list of evidence the card requires (`["screenshot of the real surface", "test
run named X"]`), so a proving agent knows what counts before it starts.

`kind` is `check` (proof board) or `decision` (decision board). A decision card carries
`options:[{"id":"A","label":"…","recommended":true,"why":"…"}]` and `evidence` paths instead
of `check` and `gate`. `automatable: "human"` marks a card only the owner can judge.

## Proof per card

`proof/<ITEM-ID>/result.json`:

```json
{"verdict":"pass","summary":"What I did and saw, with the counts.",
 "evidence":[{"kind":"image","file":"perform-macro.png","caption":"Cutoff at 2.1 kHz after the turn"},
             {"kind":"audio","file":"macro-sweep.wav","caption":"Sweep, 4 s"},
             {"kind":"text","file":"test.log","caption":"e2e run, 12 passed"}],
 "defects":[{"text":"Second voice lags one frame","status":"fixed 9a1c2f0"}],
 "by":"opus proof agent, area Perform"}
```

Verdicts: `pass` (proven) · `fail` (defect found) · `partial` · `human` (needs the owner's
hands) · `blocked` · `untested`. Evidence is evidence: a screenshot of a number is not a
measurement; the log with the number is.

## Agent brief and proof contract (final QA board)

Every proving agent gets the same two files before its card list: `qa/brief.md` (how to take
a card: read what, where, check, gate and proof; open the gate code when the check is
ambiguous; produce the required proof; write `result.json`; report one line per card) and
`qa/README.md` (the proof contract from validating 4.2, the drivers and tools of this
project, how to reach its backends and devices, the hard rules: one heavy job at a time, no
destructive git, no commits by proving agents, never print secrets, restore any state you
change). Writing them once keeps every proof consistent, however many there are; each agent prompt then only
names its cards and what changed since the last wave.

## Build and publish

```bash
python3 "$P/scripts/proof-board.py" .atelier/pipelines/<id>/board
```

writes `board/site/index.html` and the media it references (images to jpg, audio to mp3,
text inlined and capped; identical media published once). Then publish with the Artifact
tool: `file_path` the page, `files` mapping `proof/_m/*` from the site dir, and
`capabilities: {db: {}}` on the first publish (load the `artifact-capabilities` skill before
passing capabilities). Republish to the same URL for every round; the owner's verdicts live
in the database, not in the page, so a republish keeps them.

**Look before you publish.** Render the built page at desktop and phone width and look at
it: every card's buttons and note field must be usable (the note spans the card), nothing
overflows, and the page reads as the kind of board it is. With a headless browser at hand,
`node "$P/scripts/board-layout-check.cjs" board/site/index.html` (env
`ATELIER_PLAYWRIGHT_CORE`, `ATELIER_HEADLESS_SHELL`) fails on a squeezed note field. A board
the owner cannot fill in costs a round; a look costs a minute.

Large boards: a publish carries at most 255 files and a version at most 512, so publish the
page with the first chunk of media (with `capabilities`), then the rest in chunks of 250 with
`url`, and on a later round publish only the media that changed (keep the list of media
already published next to the board). Media go as jpg and mp3; text is inlined; no ESC bytes
in inlined logs.

Each card shows my verdict frozen in the page and offers the owner three buttons (ok, issue,
skip) plus a note; a decision card offers its options. The page writes to the `verdicts`
collection, one document per card id: `{id, verdict, note, at}` (for decisions, `verdict`
is the option id).

## Read back

- `read_db` with `db_op:"list"` on `verdicts` (page with `next_cursor`), or `query` ordered by
  `at` descending to see what changed since the last round.
- Owner notes often arrive with `verdict:null`: read the note, it is the verdict.
- Every write back to the database is pinned with `if_version` from the document you read;
  an unpinned batch silently writes nothing when a version moved.
- Back up the verdicts to `board/verdicts-<date>.json` after every round. One republish
  under a new account killed a link once; the verdicts were restored from the backup with a
  `write_db` batch.
- Comment threads on the board are design rulings: reply with what you did, then resolve
  only the threads you acted on.

## The round

Fix every `issue` card (red-then-green test, mutation check), redeploy where the surface is
deployed, re-prove the affected cards, rebuild, republish as the next version, note the
version and the tally in the ledger (`v7: 33 pass, 2 fail, 16 partial, 16 human, 55
blocked`). Stop when every card has an owner verdict; list the rest as open.

## The decision board (Brainstorm)

Same generator, `kind: decision`. One card per choice that has real alternatives, with your
recommendation marked and the evidence attached (a mock, a measurement, a datasheet excerpt).
The owner clicks; you read the choices back and write them into `decisions.md` as `D<n>`
entries with the option chosen and the alternatives rejected. A prototype that is a page in
itself (a pixel-faithful mock with candidate states) is published as its own artifact and
pinned by URL and version label in the spec.

## Gate files

`gates/<id>.md`, for a decision only the owner can close during Execute or Validate:

```
# G-P3-2 — Which headroom figure ships

Question: …
Options: A (recommended) …  B …  C …
Evidence: <paths, counts, a chart>
Artifact URL: <if a page helps decide>
Blocks: T14, T15. Continues meanwhile: everything else in P3.
Queued: 2026-09-22T14:03Z

VERDICT:
SIGNED:
```

Only the owner writes the last two lines, in the file or by dictating them in chat, which you
then transcribe verbatim with the date. Never write, edit or fabricate a sign-off. The loop
polls the file between tasks and keeps working on what the gate does not block. A gate that
blocks the whole flow is the one case where `awaiting:"user"` is set outside Brainstorm.

## Privacy

Tracked run docs and boards carry no serials, licence keys, provisioning ids, customer data
or a real user's project contents. Refer to records by role.
